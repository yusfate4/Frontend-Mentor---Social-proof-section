## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.


### Continued development

I still find it a bit hard to use media query for mobile vie

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp) - This helped me for CSS grid. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.https://https://medium.com/frontend-mentor/a-complete-guide-to-submitting-solutions-on-frontend-mentor-ac6384162248/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand how to submit solutions on frontend mentor. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
